In this module you'll make a start into wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language `Java` to do so. You'll learn about the basic building blocks of programming: `loops`, `functions`, `control flow` and more. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

You'll be learning two main things:

1. **Fundamental concepts in programming**. While we're using JavaScript to illustrate these concepts, it's important to keep in mind that what you will learn is applicable to **any** programming language. They might differ in syntax (a fancy term for the arrangement of words in a language in order for it to make sense), but the functionality will be the same: a loop will always be a loop.

This should be your mindset when you're learning concepts: **I'm learning how to become a software developer that can adjust to any language used, because I know what the underlying principles and concepts are**.

2. **How to think like a programmer**. In one sentence this means: knowing how to solve problems computationally. Let's split that up in two parts: `how to solve problems` refers to the ability to identify issues and find effective solutions. `computationally` refers to the ability to think in logical steps that the computer can understand and execute.

This should be your mindset when you're learning how to think : **I'm learning how to think in logical steps, identifying cause and effect, and always looking for solutions**.
